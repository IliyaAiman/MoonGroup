            <p>Hey, I’m Amir Hakimi, a 19-year-old computer science student at MMU Cyberjaya. My passion for tech started back in secondary school, and I’ve been chasing that dream ever since.

                In my free time, I’m all about competitive games like Overwatch and Valorant, though occasionly i would keep it fresh by playing story games too. Outside of gaming, I try to stay active by jogging, which helps me unwind after a long day.
                
                Thanks for stopping by!</p>
