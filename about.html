        <h3>Hello! my name is Mohammad Iliya Aiman. I was born on the 28th February. <br>
            Im currently a student in MMU Ive been playing games my whole life, Ive been <br>
            trying a bunch of underatted games so that i have a pretty decent grasp on<br> 
            what the gaming industry has to offer. My favourite game is "nier automata" still one of the <br>
            best games I played eventhough it came out like 8 years ago on 2016. The games I played <br>
            are mostly action games, rpgs and survival games. Fun fact about me is eventhough I play <br>
            games alot I am also quite an athlete. I play rugby, football, table tennis, track and field, <br>
            gym and much so I can break a sweat so I can have a healthy life.

            My name is Danysh Muqhreez and my hobby is playing video games. My favourites video games<br>
            is EAFC 24 because my dream is to be a football player. I have played this game since I was 14 <br>
            years old. I knew this game from my brother because he is also a heavy gamer like me. Currently,<br>
            I'm doing my Degree studies in MMU Cyberjaya. Fun fact about me is that I am a lazy student but I<br>
            chose to pursue my degree in computer science. My height is 170 cm which kind of tall for Malaysian<br>
            people but I still feel that I am short. I love to spend my time by jogging because that is the only <br>
            time I do some healthy activities.
