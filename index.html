            <h2>Black Myth wukong</h2>
            <p><small>Posted on September 15, 2024 by Iliya Aiman</small></p>
            <p>If you're longing or searching for an epic singleplayer game that is rich with lore, cool weapons, armors and bosses! say no more. This game can offer 
                you all that. Black Myth: Wukong, produced by developer Game Science (GS), has already generated an estimated $800-900m in revenue to date and will help
                project Chinese culture to a global audience. The game, believed to be China's first AAA video game, was developed at a reported cost of about $70m over six years
                I have played this game for more than 40 hours. After playing for that long i can tell you that its super worth it. Why you may ask? Firstly the bosses are super unique.
                Their moveset is always different and challenging. It reminds me of the soulsborne game. Not just that, the bosses are also based on the book "journey to the west"
                which is a classical Chinese novel.I struggle alot with most of the bosses, you really need to learn and abuse some of the mechanics in game.
                Other than that, the weapons are superb. There are more than 30 types of weapons and armour in game. These armory can be enchanced as the story progress, all you need is 
                to find the right materials. The game also has a very good storyline. The story is based on the journey to the west. I dont wanna spoil that much about the story, all i can
                say is it is very engaging and has alot of twist and turns. Overall, Black Myth wukong has been a very good experience for me and maybe for you guys as well. The game can be 
                played on PC, Xbox or PS5.

            <h2>Helldivers 2</h2>
            <p><small>Posted on September 11, 2024 by Iliya Aiman</small></p>
            <p>When I first heard about Helldivers, I was intrigued by its reputation as a challenging, cooperative twin-stick shooter. The idea of diving into intergalactic
               battles with friends sounded like a chaotic yet thrilling experience, so I decided to enlist in the fight. From the moment I dropped onto my first planet, I knew 
               I was in for a wild ride. Jumping into Helldivers was like being thrown into the deep end of a galactic war. The game doesn't hold your hand; it expects you to learn
               on the fly. And that learning curve was part of the fun. My first few missions were filled with frantic moments, trying to keep up with the action while avoiding getting
               obliterated by both aliens and my own teammates' fire. Yes, friendly fire is very much a thing in Helldivers, and it added an extra layer of tension and hilarity to every 
               encounter. The core gameplay of Helldivers is all about teamwork and strategy. Each mission requires you to work closely with your squad, coordinating attacks, calling in
               reinforcements, and completing objectives while being constantly on guard. What struck me the most was how every victory felt earned. There's no easy path to success here 
               every mission is a test of your skill, coordination, and sometimes sheer luck.Friendly fire is both a curse and a source of endless amusement. There were countless times 
               when a misfired grenade or a poorly timed airstrike wiped out half the team, leading to chaotic moments of laughter and frustration. It made communication and coordination 
               essential, as every action had to be carefully planned to avoid turning a successful mission into a disaster. One of the most enjoyable aspects of Helldivers was upgrading
               my armory and strategizing my loadout. As you progress through the game, you unlock new weapons and stratagems that open up different playstyles. I quickly learned the importance 
               of balancing my loadout, opting for a mix of heavy firepower and support equipment. My go-to setup became a combination of high-damage weapons and health packs, ensuring that I 
               could both dish out damage and keep my team alive during the toughest battles. Choosing the right stratagems was crucial. In some missions, having the ability to call in extra 
               ammo or deploy a turret made all the difference. Other times, it was all about mobility and quick escapes. Adapting to the challenges of each mission and upgrading my arsenal accordingly 
               became a key part of the strategy. </p>

            <p>"Helldivers" is packed with memorable moments, from epic victories to hilarious failures. One of my most unforgettable experiences was during a high-stakes 
               mission where we had to hold off a massive alien swarm while waiting for extraction. Just when we thought we were in the clear, I accidentally called in an airstrike on our location. 
               The entire squad went down in a blaze of glory, laughing at the absurdity of it all. Moments like these are what make Helldivers so much fun. Helldivers is an exhilarating, chaotic experience 
               that perfectly balances teamwork, strategy, and a healthy dose of humor. It's the kind of game that creates unforgettable memories with friends, whether you're pulling off a 
               flawless mission or accidentally blowing each other up. The constant challenge and the need for coordination make every successful mission feel like a true accomplishment. If you're looking for 
               a cooperative shooter that will test your skills and provide endless laughs, Helldivers is definitely worth a dive.
