                <h2>Game Review</h2>
                <p>If you're longing or searching for an epic singleplayer game that is rich with lore, cool weapons, armors and bosses! say no more. 
                    This game can offer you all that. Black Myth: Wukong, produced by developer Game Science (GS), has already generated an estimated $800-900m in revenue to date and will help project Chinese culture to a global audience. 
                    The game, believed to be China's first AAA video game, was developed at a reported cost of about $70m over six years I have played this game for more than 40 hours. After playing for that long i can tell you that its super worth it. 
                    Why you may ask? Firstly the bosses are super unique. Their moveset is always different and challenging. It reminds me of the soulsborne game. Not just that, the bosses are also based on the book "journey to the west" which is a classical Chinese novel.I struggle alot with most of the bosses, you really need to learn and abuse some of the mechanics in game. Other than that, the weapons are superb. There are more than 30 types of weapons and armour in game. These armory can be enchanced as the story progress, all you need is to find the right materials. The game also has a very good storyline. The story is based on the journey to the west. I dont wanna spoil that much about the story, all i can say is it is very engaging and has alot of twist and turns. Overall, Black Myth wukong has been a very good experience for me and maybe for you guys as well. The game can be played on PC, Xbox or PS5.
